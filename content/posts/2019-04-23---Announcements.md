After several changes we have prepared a compilation on these restructurings in our business plan and how this will reflect on our development operations in the future.

A question that is often directed at us; 
Why do we change? Why offer a service network?

## Why change?

Making the future a better place is our motto as a consequence of this goal changes and improvements in our departments is constant considerated this feeling we did not go been productive enough to bring great advances in corporate products and services, not for insufficiency of our employees or managers but yes by the limitation of our allocation of resources and time therefore we effected our disconnection in development new products and services destined corporative entities.

## Our success

Since 2016, in our foundation, we have developed and offered libraries to facilitate the lives of our programmers. We have been present in many organizations in Brazil and we can thank those  these organizations that helped our managers to develop and clarify their ideas so that together with our collaborators we could offer the best product and service to our customers.

## Our mistakes

Our business plan as its main objective has always been to build a diversified service chain that could be accessible to all social layers with a single decentralized goal, censorship in data exploitation, interaction, cooperation, speed, buying and selling and affordable. However this involved some difficulty in making our chain of services profitable in the long run to our shareholders and advertisers and from a majority decision we decided to start acting in the corporate scenario in order to build a network and a more stable legal vision of our organization and in this we reached our goal but in a deeper vision we were facing a great financial crisis by the simple fact of investing 6 months in a corporate product in months we closed our cash flow positive and in others we closed below the forecast and this we imply a network of questions and difficulties about our financial operations. We hope in the future with our stable and solid social data layer that we can offer new products to companies.
